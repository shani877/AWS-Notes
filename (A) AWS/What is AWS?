🗺️ Key Components of AWS Global Infrastructure

✅ Regions

* What: Geographical areas where AWS has data centers
* Current Count (2025): 35 regions (and growing)
* Example:

  * US East (N. Virginia)
  * Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
  * Europe (Frankfurt)
* Note: Each region is independent, physically separated, and designed for data sovereignty

---

✅ Availability Zones (AZs)

* What: One or more data centers within a region
* Purpose: To provide high availability and fault tolerance
* Each region has: 2–6 Availability Zones
* Connectivity: AZs are connected by low-latency, high-speed links
* Example: US East (N. Virginia) has 6 AZs named `us-east-1a` to `us-east-1f`

---

✅ Edge Locations

* What: Data centers for Content Delivery & DNS (CloudFront, Route 53)
* Use: Fast delivery of static & dynamic content globally
* Current Count: Over 400+ Edge Locations

---

✅ Local Zones

* What: Extension of an AWS Region, closer to large population centers
* Use Case: Low-latency apps like gaming, video editing, real-time analytics
* Example: Los Angeles, Dallas, Chennai, Bangkok

---

✅ Wavelength Zones

* What: AWS infrastructure deployed at 5G telecom networks
* Use Case: Ultra-low latency for mobile apps and edge computing
* Partners: Verizon, Vodafone, KDDI, etc.

---

✅ AWS Outposts

* What: AWS services brought to your on-premises location
